# Potential-Gene-interactions-w-BRCA1

**Research Goal**
- Identify which of the potential interactions in a String network involve genes expressed in the same tissue.

**Analysis**

Plan 
*     Filter the gene interaction data for interactions with the BRCA1 gene, and extract the list from DB1
*     Filter the gene expression data for tissues that express the BRCA1 gene in levels of medium to high, and also for tissues that have interaction with BRCA1 w/in DB2
*     Add the tissues that show an expression to a summary table
